# Genome-skimming with Oxford Nanopore sequences
This protocol is to assemble and annotate whole mitochondrial genomes from Oxford Nanopore sequences, or from a combination of Nanopore and Illumina short-read data. This pipeline is designed run multiple samples simultanteously on [Hydra](https://confluence.si.edu/display/HPC/High+Performance+Computing), Smithsonian's HPC. 

If you have only Oxford Naopore sequences, we will first QC the reads (using [nanoQC](https://github.com/wdecoster/nanoQC), [ToulligQC](https://github.com/GenomiqueENS/toulligQC) and [NanoPlot](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot), which all give slightly different but useful outputs) and trim and filter where necessary using [Chopper](https://github.com/wdecoster/chopper/). We will then create assemblies using [Flye](https://github.com/mikolmogorov/Flye) and polish (i.e. error-correct assemblies) with [Medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka). We then annotate using [Mitofinder](https://github.com/RemiAllio/MitoFinder) and/or [Mitos](https://gitlab.com/Bernt/MITOS).
