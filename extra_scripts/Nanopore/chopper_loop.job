# This job file loads the conda module, activates the fastp environment,
# and runs fastp to trim all paired raw reads.

# These are the commands given to fastp, with a brief description. For 
# more information please see the manual:
# https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp

# -i and -I are the R1 and R2 input files, respectively. These are demultiplexed
# illumina read files

# -o and -O are the output files for the trimmed R1 and R2 reads, respectively.
# These are for paired trimmed R1 and R2 reads for which both reads have
#  survived trimming and filtering.

# --unpaired1 and --unpaired2 are for trimmed R1 and R2 reads that do not have
# a paired read that survived trimming and filtering. NOTE: You can use the same
# file name for both --unpaired1 and --unpaired2, which will result in a single
# file containing all unpaired (single-end or SE) reads, so no concatenation is
# necessary for downstream applications.

# -h creates an html file that show a graphical representation of read quality
# and base frequency pre- and post- trimming, similar to shown by FastQC.

# -l <length> This is the mimimum length required to keep a read. If the
# read is below this length it will be removed.

# -f <length> This trims the user-defined number of base pairs from the 5' end
# of all R1 reads.

# -F <length> This trims the user-defined number of base pairs from the 5' end
# of all R2 reads.

# -t <length> This trims the user-defined number of base pairs from the 3' end
# of all R1 reads.

# -T <length> This trims the user-defined number of base pairs from the 3' end
# of all R2 reads.

# --cut_tail This tells fastp to quality trim the 3' end of both R1 and R2 using
# a sliding window, similar to SLIDINGWINDOW in trimmomatic.

# --cut_tail_window_size <length> This is the size of the sliding window for
# quality trimming.

# --cut_tail_mean_quality <mean_quality_score> This is the mean quality score
#  necessary for the sliding window to reach to be kept.

# --adapter_fasta <path_to_primer_file> This points fastp to the user-defined
# adapter file.
